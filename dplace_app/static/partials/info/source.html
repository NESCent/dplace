        Database data

        <div class="introduction">
        <p><b>Cultural data:</b><br>
            To date, D-PLACE includes cultural data from two major cross-cultural databases: the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock 1962-1971; Gray 1999; Korotayev et al. 2004; Bondarenko et al. 2005) and the Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset (Binford 2001). Both cross-cultural datasets use codes to characterize the cultural practices of a ‘society,’ or group of people with a shared language and cultural identity at a given location and point in time. The cultural practices characterized in each dataset are diverse, for example describing aspects of local marriage systems, subsistence economies, political institutions, and house architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ethnographic Atlas (EA) describes XX cultural practices for 1292 societies, ranging from small hunter-gatherer groups to societies with complex agricultural economies and political systems. The societies are globally distributed with especially good coverage of Africa and western North America.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset describes cultural practices for all 339 “hunter gatherer groups known to exist during colonial and more recent era […] that were described with sufficient detail to be included in a comparative analysis” (Binford 2001: 130). Some of the cultural practices described in Binford’s dataset overlap with those of the EA (e.g., subsistence economy, marriage system), while others are distinct (e.g., social group size, mobility). Approximately 60% of the societies described by Binford are also described in the EA. Relative to the EA, the Binford database includes many more societies in Australia and in northern North America. 
        </p>
        <p><b>What is the original source of the cultural data?</b><br>
            The Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset describes cultural practices for all 339 “hunter gatherer groups known to exist during colonial and more recent era […] that were described with sufficient detail to be included in a comparative analysis” (Binford 2001: 130). Some of the cultural practices described in Binford’s dataset overlap with those of the EA (e.g., subsistence economy, marriage system), while others are distinct (e.g., social group size, mobility). Approximately 60% of the societies described by Binford are also described in the EA. Relative to the EA, the Binford database includes many more societies in Australia and in northern North America. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In deciding how to interpret the cultural data in D-PLACE, we encourage users to consider not just the focal year and location to which the data refer, but also uncertainty in code assignment. This is likely to reflect, among other things, intra-cultural variability in a practice, the familiarity of source ethnographers with the society in question (for example, fluency in the local language, time spent living with the society), and the ease with which a cultural practice can be inferred by an ethnographer (for example, we might expect more accuracy in descriptions of house shape than in descriptions of religious beliefs; Whiting 1981; Burton and White 1987).
        </p>
        <p>
            To facilitate users’ consideration of uncertainty, we have tagged each cultural ‘data point’ (i.e., description of a cultural practice for a particular society) with the ethnographic source(s) that the author of the cross-cultural dataset used to to code it. We have also digitized any notes published with the cross-cultural codes, which often describe intra-society deviations from dominant practices, and/or changes in practices over time. These are called ‘comments’ in D-PLACE.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each society, a set of geographic coordinates describes the approximate location to which the cultural data refer. In some cases, additional details are also provided on the community or settlement that is the focus of the ethnographic description. The geographic coordinates were used in the process of linking each society to a language (see linguistic data, below), and provided the basis for the extraction of environmental and climate data for each society (see environmental data, below). The coordinates also provide the basis for map-based analyses in D-PLACE.

                Ethnographic Atlas
            </h3>
            <p>
                The original Ethnographic Atlas was published in twenty-one installments by George P. Murdock (Murdock 1962-1966, 1967, 1968, 1971). Subsequent data installments included not just ‘new’ data, but also corrections to data published in previous installments. Three decades later, J. Patrick Gray compiled these corrections in a “Corrected Ethnographic Atlas,” which includes 1265 societies and 112 cultural variables. It also replaces Murdock’s letter-based codes with numeric codes (Gray 1999). This dataset is available as a single, flat file through the journal World Cultures. To the Gray (1999) dataset, we have made the following changes. First, we went back to Murdock’s original codes, and ‘de-aggregated’ any codes that were aggregated by Gray (1999) (see Codebook, for details), in order to avoid loss of information. Next, we eliminated or condensed variables that split a single piece of information (e.g., society name, or year of data collection) over multiple fields (variables 100-111, v114-v115). We also omitted non-cultural data that appears in Gray (1999), but that D-PLACE is explicitly designed to improve upon, including variables describing region (v91, v92), climate (v95, v96), and linguistic affiliation (v97-v99). We deleted two societies in Gray (1999) that appeared to be doubles of other societies (Na18, XXX), and added data for 27 societies in Eurasia recently coded for the Ethnographic Atlas by Korotayev et al. (2004) and Bondarenko et al. (2005).

            <p>
                In 2001, Lewis R. Binford published a monograph focused on the potential for building archaeological theory using a global dataset on hunter-gatherer societies (Binford 2001). In it, he published data tables summarizing a sample of cultural practices for 339 hunter-gatherer societies. We include in D-PLACE data from tables 5.01, 6.03, 8.01, 8.04, 8.07, 8.08 and 9.01. Although some of these tables include data describing societies’ local environments, we retain only those variables that describe the societies themselves. Data for focal year, and some variable names were obtained from documentation accompanying Binford and Johnson (2006). For additional inforamtion, we refer users to the website of Binford’s long-time collaborator, Amber Johnson (<a href="http://ajohnson.sites.truman.edu/data-and-program/" target="_blank">http://ajohnson.sites.truman.edu/data-and-program/</a>)

                Links to other cross-cultural datasets
            </h3>
            <p>
                In order to facilitate access to supplementary cultural data for D-PLACE societies, we provide information on whether each society appears in other major cross-cultural databases. For example, about 14% of the societies in the EA also appear in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), for which over 2000 cultural variables have been coded (White and Murdock 1969). Similarly, approximately 24% of the societies in the EA are included in the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF; Murdock 1983), a repository of annotated primary literature that can be searched by topic (e.g., marriage system). The cross-coding considers whether records share a focal time and place in addition to a focal “society” (e.g., records for “Samoa” in the SCCS and EA may not correspond as they have a different focal time (1829 vs. 1920) and place (Western Samoa vs. American Samoa; Ember et al. 1992; Ember 2007).

                Linguistic data
            </h3>
            <p>
                Summary: Currently, two levels of control on sample independence are possible in D-PLACE. First, because the broad linguistic affiliation of all societies in D-PLACE is known, users can use language family as a coarse- level control of relatedness among societies. Second, a large portion of the societies in each database belong to a language family for which a well-resolved phylogenetic tree is available. These trees allow for much more detailed controls on relatedness; for example, relative time-since-language-divergence can be used as a measure of relative distance among societies. The following section briefly describes the methods we used to link societies to language families and phylogenetic trees. The distribution of D-PLACE societies among language families, and their representation on the phylogenetic trees included in D-PLACE are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Methods: Society-language matches were triangulated using a combination of geographic coordinates, bibliographic information from the original EA or Binford databases (White 1989; White 1990; Binford 2001), and online sources – especially Ethnologue and MultiTree (Lewis et al. 2013; LINGUIST List 2009). Geographic coordinates for each society were obtained from their source publications (Gray 1999; Binford 2001; Korotayev et al. 2004; Bondarenko et al. 2005), and coordinates for languages were obtained from the World Language Mapping System (GMI 2005). Each society was linked to its most commonly spoken language. However, multiple societies were often assigned the same language (e.g., the EA database includes information on 17 Shoshone-speaking societies). For the societies for which an ISO 693 code has yet to be assigned, we use a D-PLACE serial number as a place-holder. Once assigned a language and ISO693 code/serial number, we were able to link each society to a language family using a corrected version of the “classification” field of Lewis et al. (2013; correction by C. Bowern and M. Dunn; available as an accessory file on the D-PLACE site). Societies speaking creoles or pidgins were assigned a language family by a linguist. For the X language families for which we had access to a phylogeny, including Austronesian, Bantu, Uto-Aztecan, Pama-Nyungan, Indo-European and Semitic (…), society-language matches were used to map societies to the ‘tips’ of the phylogenetic trees. A few of these phylogenies are well-represented by EA societies (e.g., 105 EA societies mapped to Austronesian tree (Gray et al. XX); 93 EA societies on the Bantu tree (REF)); highlighting the potential for D-PLACE to be used in analyses of multiple cultural traits and their inter-relationships.

                Environmental data
            </h3>
            <p>
Sampling localities: Ecological variables were sampled at the localities reported in the Ethnographic Atlas. Georeferences were fact-checked by comparison with the corresponding ISO language range centroid localities and additional confirmation with the original ethnographies when needed. We provide in this data set the original EA coordinates as well as the corrected localities used for ecological analysis. Societies were identified as coastal when their sampling locality was 50km or less from a major water body.
            <p>
Historical Data: Because a majority of societies in the Ethnographic Atlas were sampled between 1901 and 1950, we attempted when possible to characterize the ecological characteristics at each sampling locality for this particular time period. For each society, we computed the mean, variance, and predictability of the entire annual cycles of precipitation and temperature based on monthly global maps (0.5 by 0.5 degree cells) obtained from the CRU-TS 3.1 Climate Database (Harris et al. 2013). Predictability was measured via Colwell’s (1974) Constancy, Contingency and Predictability indexes. These indexes capture the extent to which yearly cycles vary among years in terms of onset, intensity and duration, ranging from 0 (completely unpredictable) to 1 (fully predictable).
          <p>
Contemporary Data: Contemporary values are reported for variables in which the optimal range of historical data was not available. Monthly net primary production data was obtained from the MODIS dataset (available at:
http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD17A2_M_PSN). Last accessed 10 Jan 2014; Data range: 2000-2013). From these data we computed the mean annual productivity at each site and determined the months of the year in which net primary production is positive (hereafter "Mean Growing Season"). Estimates of the number of species at each locality were obtained for birds, mammals, and amphibians from Jenkins et al. (2013) and for vascular plants from Kreft and Jetz (2007). Ecoregions data were obtained from Olson et al. (2001) and elevation data were obtained from the GTOPO30 data set (available at: lpdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/gtopo30.asp. Last accessed 17 April 2012).          </p>
